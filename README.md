source : 
keras -> https://keras.io
tensorflow -> https://www.tensorflow.org

Initial training project url : http://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/

Dataset is using german credit card bank
url :https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)

Neural network model is saved with HDF5 format, to convert into json using (https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5-json)
Run in terminal (Mac OS)
-> python3.5 h5tojson.py model.h5 > model.json
